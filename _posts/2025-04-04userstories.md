As a commuter in the city of Poway,
I want to access real-time traffic patterns, including congestion levels, accidents, and road closures,
so that I can plan my routes efficiently, avoid delays, and make the best use of my time while traveling.

Real-Time Traffic Data:
I can view up-to-date traffic conditions, including congestion levels, accidents, and road closures, for routes within Poway.

Historical Traffic Patterns:
The system provides historical traffic data to help me predict patterns for specific times of the day and days of the week, so I can choose optimal travel times.

Alternate Route Suggestions:
Based on traffic conditions, the system suggests alternate routes to help me avoid congestion and save time.

Push Notifications and Alerts:
I can opt-in for push notifications or alerts to be informed about traffic incidents (accidents, construction) and other disruptions that may affect my travel plans.

Mobile Access:
I can access this information via a mobile app or website to easily check traffic patterns and make adjustments during my commute.

Route Comparison:
The system compares routes to suggest the fastest or most efficient travel options based on live traffic data.

I want to avoid being stuck in traffic during my morning commute. I use a traffic app that shows live updates on road conditions in Poway, including real-time congestion, accidents, and closures. Based on this data, the app suggests an alternate route, and I get a push notification alerting me about an accident blocking my usual route, allowing me to avoid the area and reach my destination faster.
