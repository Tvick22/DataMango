**Wyatt's User Story**

- First, I opened up the page

- I was welcomed to an easy to use, well-formatted website

- I clicked on the "Traffic Map"

- I used the interactive map to find the quickest way home by swiping left, right, up, down, and zooming in

- I was easily able to identify where would have the most traffic by using the color-coded map

- I tried my new route home and found that it was much quicker than before, and there was almost no traffic
